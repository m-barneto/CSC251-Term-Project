This project contains 3 things:

1. The startup code for Lab03 (package: contactCRUD)
2. MySQL and FX installation validation programs (package: edu.waketech.csc251.validate.mysql, edu.waketech.csc251.validate.mysql_and_fx)
3. Textbook examples and lecture examples (all other packages)

In order for the programs to work, you need to have your MySQL server running and the database called "javabook" created and populated according to the instructions under Blackboard "Lessons"->"Lesson 03"->"Step 3 - Validate that MySQL and JavaFX Work" section to find out how to use it.

You can study the code under the "productCRUD" package to help you understand JDBC and complete your assignment by completing the missing code in the "contactCRUD" package.
